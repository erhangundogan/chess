* playchess is pure javascript chess game client.
* MeteorJS enables realtime(reactive) chess gameplay between opponents.
* It is wrapped with MeteorJS but it can be used with any other framework.
* It can be connected to backend system so there can be brute force, valuation or even ai logic to drive game play.
